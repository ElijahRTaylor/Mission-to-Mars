# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
In an effort to create  an application where we can scrape data from different websites about the Mission to Mars. 

## Method
Since we are collecting, non relational data, we use MongoDB, a NoSQL database.  Once we have scraped all of the webpages, we render our data in a web application created with Flask. With the use of basic HTML and Bootstrap, we're able to customize the appearance of our web application pretty easily.
